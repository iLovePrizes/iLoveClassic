Please stop using iLoveClassic.

Discord has patched this bug.
Whenever the script opens the subscription/gift link, discord will redirect you immediately to "https://discord.com/app?result_type=cancel", which makes buying classic impossible from now on.

I will no longer update this, no matter if another exploit works or not.
